          <h2><b>Overflow from Conferences:</b></h2>
          <h3>Junior Senior Conference 2018 Overflow from the YP:</h3>
          <p>"I was touched in this conference that being saved is not a matter of what we do for God, but what God gives to us! Our Christian life is not one of service, but of enjoyment! Our response should be to praise the Lord and dine in the Father's house with all the brothers and sisters, ushering others into the enjoyment! We're not doing empty rituals, but touching and experiencing the unsearchably rich Christ as our deposit! Our friends need to see the good deposit within our spirit expressed, not a life of sorrow and strife. Praise the Lord for His working in us!"</p>

          <p></p>
          <p>I was touched with what D said, plus you shouldn't major in basket weaving or philosophy...I guess what I mean is your choice of major and school should not only be between you and the Lord but also with the fellowship of the saints, plus it should be practical. Fellowship was stressed this weekend.</p>

          <h3>Northeast SSoT 2018 Overflow: The Church</h3>
          <p>"[In Phillipians 1:20,] 'Whether through life or through death' could also mean situations of spiritual life and death within our daily lives. I realized that no matter where we are, in the meetings full of spirit or at school filled with death, we need to magnify Christ in our body so that we can be His testimony. Magnifying Christ is not conditional, but should be carried out constantly through our living in all situations ('as always'). Oh Lord, please cause me to turn to You every moment of my lives. Lord Jesus, work in me. Replace my self with only You. Lord Jesus, I love You. I want to cooperate with You for Your purpose."</p>
          <p>-D (Anonymous Brother)</p>
          <p>"Let no one despise your youth"... The key word here is <i>let</i>; sometimes we feel that the older ones treat us as little kids or not members, but that could be because of our behavior (being a "satellite", not cleaning, etc). So <i>let</i> no one despise your youth!</p>
          <h2><b>Daily Enjoyment</b></h2>
          <h5>November 12, 2018</h5>
          <p>"Lord, grant us our day's supply of grace. May Your divine life grow apace! We should pray for our day-to-day supply and our continued relationship with the Lord every morning (or night for the next day) for our supply in life. Our faith is so easily obstructed by our dealings in the flesh. We should turn to the spirit and rely on the Lord as our unique supply for our daily living in the world."</p>
