                </h2>
                <p>From <a href="https://www.lsm.org/lsm-statement-faith.html">LSM's Statement of Faith</a></p>
                <p>"Holding the Bible as the complete and only divine revelation, we strongly believe that God is eternally one and also eternally the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three being distinct but not separate. We hold that Christ is both the complete God and the perfect man. Without abandoning His divinity, He was conceived in the womb of a human virgin, lived a genuine human life on earth, and died a vicarious and all-inclusive death on the cross. After three days He resurrected bodily and has ascended to the heavens. He is now in glory, fully God but still fully man. We look to His imminent return with the kingdom of God, by which He will reign over the earth in the millennium and in eternity. We confess that the third of the Trinity, the Spirit, is equally God. All that the Father has and is, is expressed by the Son; and all that the Son has and is, is realized as the Spirit. We further believe that mankind is in need of God's salvation. Though we were absolutely unable to fulfill the heavy demands of God's righteousness, holiness, and glory, Christ fulfilled all the requirements through His death on the cross. Because of Christ's death, God has forgiven us of our sins, justified us by making Christ our righteousness and reconciled us to Himself. Based on Christ's redemption, God regenerates the redeemed with His Spirit to consummate His salvation, that they may become His children. Now possessing God's life and nature, the believers enjoy a daily salvation in His Body in this age and the eternal salvation in the coming age and in eternity. In eternity we will dwell with God in the New Jerusalem, the consummation of God's salvation of His elect."</p>
                <p class="mb-0"><em>All</em> Christians who believe Jesus is Lord and Savior are brothers and sisters in the Body of Christ. Though there are many meeting halls in each city, there is only one church, because <i>eklesia</i> the Greek word used for church in the Bible denotes an assembly, a group of people, and not a building. There should be no division!</p>

	                <h5>How lovely is Thy dwelling place!</h5>
	                <h5>My soul longs for the courts of the Lord</h5>
	                <h5>My heart and my flesh; they sing for joy to the living God</h5>
	                <h5>You are my King and my God!</h5>
	                <p>As this hymn says, the church is the house of the living God, and is His delight. Ephesians 2:19 says, "So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God. " All the genuine believers are “fellow citizens”, a part of God's family. In the early 1980s, under God’s sovereign arrangement, a group of Christians moved to Central New Jersey for study or employment. They loved the Lord and pursued Him,  actively seeking communication with other believers. Like in Acts 2:42, “...they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers”, beginning with Christian family gatherings near Rutgers State University. By the blessings of the Lord and the saints spreading the gospel together, new believers were saved continually. Soon the gathering of the saints' homes was no longer sufficient and nearby hotels were rented for the Lord’s Table meetings: first in Sheraton, then in Marriott. Four conference halls were rented every Sunday to cope with various languages. In 1986, the Lord led us to find the "Emmanuel House" in Franklin Park, a meeting place previously owned by brothers. After this, the number of saints increased from tens to hundreds. In the early 1990s, the saints accepted the burden from the Lord and carried out the testimony of the Lord to the north and the east. In 1994, in Nutley, Manalapan purchased new meeting halls to expand. Believers have grown to more than a thousand people over the years, distributed in Middlesex, Somerset, Mercer, Monmouth, Union, Morris and other counties. There are more than fifty meeting halls. We look forward to having communication with all believers in Christ. What God accepts is what we accept. We are willing to follow the teachings of the Bible simply. We serve the Lord as one Body and express Him. We greatly welcome all those who are pursuing the Lord to be with us to witness the church, the New Man. There is no distinction between race, culture, and social class status. Christ is everything.</p>
